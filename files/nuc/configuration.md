## i5 NUC Purchased 8/15/2014
This is unused currently, with a unmaintained win10pro instance installed and accessible over VNC.  The WD Red died and was replaced with a SSD that was subsequently removed to just run off the mSATA drive.  So the total current config is NUC+ram+mSATA+wifi/bluetooth for a purchase cost of about $580 at that time.
